# go-urban
Simple CLI for GO that looks up words on Urban Dictionary

# Usage
go urban -word=ball -count=10

# Purpose
I want to learn go, I like looking up random words on Urban Dictionary for laughs and I got tired of opening chrome to do this. I figured a CLI tool could be useful in satisfying all three.
